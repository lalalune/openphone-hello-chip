# U-Boot port scaffold

U-Boot starts after the Chipyard/Rocket software reference can boot OpenSBI and
expose RAM, UART, timer, and interrupt devices tied to
`sw/platform/e1_platform_contract.json`.

Repo-local command:

```sh
make software-bsp-check
python3 sw/check_bsp_scaffolds.py boot
```

Expected output:

```text

  dependency blocker: CPU-capable SoC integration with RAM, UART, timer, interrupt controller, OpenSBI handoff
  status: clear
```

Dependency blocker: a real U-Boot port requires a working OpenSBI handoff,
DRAM map, UART console, timer, interrupt controller, boot media, and device tree
from the CPU-capable target. Until then this directory is documentation-only and
must not be treated as boot evidence.
