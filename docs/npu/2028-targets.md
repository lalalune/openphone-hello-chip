# 2028 NPU Target

This is the OpenPhone performance target for a best-in-class 2028 Android
phone NPU. It is intentionally higher than the current `hello_npu` RTL, which
remains an L0 unit demonstrator. The target is used to steer architecture,
verification, compiler, Android HAL, and benchmark work without pretending the
current repo has phone-class silicon.

## Current Public Signals

The 2026 public SOTA direction is clear:

| Anchor | Public signal | Design consequence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 | Hexagon NPU is advertised as 37% faster, 16% better performance per watt, with INT2 and FP8 support. | Low precision and mixed precision must be first-class, not a later extension. |
| MediaTek Dimensity 9500 | NPU 990 claims up to 56% lower peak power, over 2x token-generation speed, and a CIM-based efficient NPU. | Data movement dominates. SRAM locality, compression, sparsity, and always-on efficiency matter as much as MAC count. |
| Samsung Exynos 2600 | NPU claims 113% better generative-AI performance with lower latency and power plus ExecuTorch support. | The software stack must target real model deployment paths, not only synthetic GEMM. |
| Qualcomm Snapdragon X2 family | Laptop-class integrated NPU listings show 80 TOPS and 152 GB/s LPDDR5x bandwidth. | A large-battery phone should target laptop-adjacent burst AI while enforcing mobile sustained-power gates. |
| Apple A19 Pro | A 16-core Neural Engine is paired with GPU Neural Accelerators. | The AP should expose cooperative GPU/NPU scheduling for graphics-plus-AI workloads. |

## Numeric Target

The target is not a marketing TOPS target. TOPS must be reported with
precision, sparsity, thermal state, clock, power, memory bandwidth, and CPU
fallback percentage.

| Metric | 2028 target |
| --- | ---: |
| Dense INT8 peak | at least 160 TOPS |
| Dense INT8 sustained | at least 80 TOPS |
| Sparse INT4 peak | at least 512 TOPS |
| Sparse INT4 sustained | at least 200 TOPS |
| INT2 / BitNet-class peak | at least 900 TOPS |
| FP8 peak | at least 80 TFLOPS |
| Sustained INT8 efficiency | at least 18 TOPS/W |
| NPU burst power | no more than 8 W |
| NPU sustained power | no more than 4.5 W |
| Local SRAM | at least 64 MiB |
| Local SRAM bandwidth | at least 20 TB/s aggregate |
| Shared system cache | at least 32 MiB |
| External memory bandwidth | at least 180 GB/s |
| CPU fallback | no more than 1% of measured graph nodes |

## Architecture Direction

The 2028 NPU should be a tiled matrix/vector accelerator:

- 8 to 16 compute tiles.
- At least 4096 INT8 MAC units per tile, with INT4/INT2 packing paths.
- At least 4 MiB local SRAM per tile.
- Separate systolic matrix, vector activation, layout-transform, DMA, sparsity
  decode, and scalar-control engines.
- IOMMU-isolated command buffers, deep queues, per-context fault isolation, and
  cache-coherent CPU submission.
- Hardware support for transformer decode, prefill, convolution, camera AI,
  image generation, and always-on micro-NPU paths.

## Software Direction

The NPU is only real when the software stack can use it:

- AIDL HAL and fail-closed SELinux policy.
- TFLite delegate and NNAPI or successor runtime integration.
- StableHLO import through an MLIR pipeline.
- IREE or TVM backend for repeatable lowering.
- ExecuTorch/PyTorch export path for on-device model deployment.
- Benchmark evidence with unsupported-op count, CPU fallback percentage, power
  traces, thermal traces, and exact model hashes.

## Current Repo Gap

`rtl/npu/hello_npu.sv` is currently a scalar datapath plus a 64-byte scratchpad
GEMM prototype. It now includes a packed signed INT4 dot-product opcode as the
first low-precision primitive, but it is still missing the actual tensor NPU
structure:

- no tensor command queue,
- no DMA-fed scratchpad,
- no large SRAM,
- no systolic array,
- no sparse INT4 GEMM,
- no INT2 or FP8 execution,
- no compiler backend,
- no Android accelerator delegate,
- no area or power model,
- no sustained hardware benchmark evidence.

The next implementation move is to replace the scalar GEMM prototype with a
parameterized INT8/INT4 tile model and feed it through a descriptor-ring ABI.

## Evidence Gate

The current repository must stay classified as `L0_RTL_UNIT` for NPU capability
until a target report supplies all of the following:

| Evidence | Required content |
| --- | --- |
| TOPS/MAC counters | `macs_per_inference`, `npu_cycles`, `npu_hz`, `observed_tops`, and `tops_formula` derived from hardware counters |
| Precision | Actual delegate precision such as INT8, INT4, INT2, FP8, BF16, or FP16 |
| Dataflow | Named measured dataflow path, not only a GEMM math estimate |
| Descriptor queue | Queue depth, descriptor head/tail completion, timeout/error behavior, and host runtime submission proof |
| DMA | Hardware tensor-streaming DMA path and bytes read/written by the NPU workload |
| Runtime counters | Cycles, MACs, ops, errors, unsupported ops, DMA read bytes, and DMA written bytes from the measured path |
| Android HAL / NNAPI | AIDL HAL service proof, fail-closed SELinux policy, VTS/CTS results, `hello-npu` accelerator query, total/delegated node counts, zero CPU fallback, and zero unsupported ops |
| Model binding | Exact model SHA-256 and transcript hashes |

For review, TOPS is bounded by the counter evidence:

```text
observed_tops <= macs_per_inference * 2 / (npu_cycles / npu_hz) / 1e12
```

The scalar RTL cannot produce phone-class TOPS, sustained power, or Android
delegate evidence. Passing `scripts/check_npu_2028_targets.py` means the repo
keeps this distinction explicit; it does not mean the 2028 target is met.
