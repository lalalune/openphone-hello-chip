## Workstream Dashboard

| Workstream | Status | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A: RTL and formal | PASS scaffold evidence | Directed RTL/formal evidence is present, not silicon signoff. |
| B: software, boot, OS, simulation | BLOCK | QEMU PASS is qemu-virt software-reference evidence; Renode and external BSP transcripts are still required. |
| C: PD, package, board, SI/PI | BLOCK | PD contract PASS is preflight/scaffold evidence; release artifacts remain blocked. |
| D: ISP, display, real-world verification | BLOCK | Display RTL has directed checks; ISP and real-world verification remain not implemented. |
| E: toolchain and upstreams | BLOCK | Missing optional/heavy tools must stay explicit. |
| F: product, security, radios, sensors, battery | BLOCK | secure boot, cellular, Wi-Fi/BT/GNSS/NFC, sensors, and battery/PMIC/thermal need real transcripts. |

## Claim Boundaries

Product scaffold PASS means blockers are named and fail closed.
Benchmark BLOCK means reports are planning or dry-run evidence; `make benchmark-sim-metrics` is not performance evidence.
Android CTS/VTS, secure boot, radios, sensors, battery/PMIC/thermal, USB/storage/update, package, FPGA, KiCad, PD, SI/PI, and thermal release remain blocked until real evidence is archived.
