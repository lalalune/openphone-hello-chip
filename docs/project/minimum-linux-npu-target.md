# Minimum Linux + NPU Target

This is the minimum executable target for the current integration wave: boot a
basic Linux kernel on the simulated hello-chip/generated AP target and run a
deterministic INT8 ML smoke workload through the hello NPU path.

This is not Android readiness, phone-class performance, tapeout readiness, or
sustained power/thermal proof. QEMU/Renode reference boots may unblock software
plumbing, but they do not satisfy this target unless the generated hello-chip/AP
simulator is the target under test.

## Status Terms

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| present | Repo source, scaffold, or checker exists and is linked below. |
| missing | Required source or target-side command does not exist yet. |
| evidence-required | Source may exist, but the target cannot be claimed until generated artifacts, external build logs, boot transcript, or workload transcript are captured and accepted. |

## Acceptance Definition

The repo-local aggregate gate is `make minimum-linux-npu-target-check`. The
narrower basic Linux kernel gate is `make minimum-linux-target-check`; it writes
`build/reports/minimum-linux-kernel-target.json` and verifies the boot payload,
DTS, console, driver/MMIO smoke, required artifacts, and required local blocker
states before the ML workload is claimed.

The target is complete only when one generated-AP Linux transcript proves:

1. The simulator is the hello-chip/generated AP target, not qemu-virt-only.
2. The boot payload is a RISC-V ELF selected by
   `scripts/locate_chipyard_linux_payload.py` with OpenSBI and Linux payload
   markers.
3. Linux reaches a shell, init script, or equivalent command runner.
4. The DTS visible to Linux contains CPU, memory, CLINT/ACLINT, PLIC, UART
   console, DMA, display, and hello NPU nodes matching
   `sw/platform/hello_platform_contract.json`.
5. The console transcript contains `OpenSBI`, `Linux version`,
   `Kernel command line:`, and a shell/init marker.
6. The kernel exposes `/dev/hello-npu` or a documented first-bring-up
   `/dev/mem` fallback for the hello NPU MMIO range.
7. A userspace NPU ML smoke runs `GEMM_S8`, prints input hash, output hash or
   matrix values, and stable PASS/FAIL markers.
8. A checker fails closed if the transcript is missing, if the simulator is a
   reference platform, or if the ML command used CPU-only fallback.

## Closure Sequence

1. Import the BSP into an external Linux tree with
   `sw/linux/scripts/import-linux-bsp.sh /path/to/linux`.
2. Capture kernel build and DTB validation with
   `sw/linux/scripts/capture-linux-bsp-evidence.sh /path/to/linux kernel-build`
   and `dtb-check`.
3. On a Linux host with Chipyard/FireMarshal, generate OpenPhone Rocket
   artifacts, locate or build the Linux payload, and run
   `make chipyard-generated-ap-boot chipyard-verilator-linux-smoke-check`.
4. Capture complete generated-AP serial boot and runtime MMIO/NPU smoke logs.
5. Run `make minimum-linux-target-check` and then
   `make minimum-linux-npu-target-check`. Until the generated AP Linux
   transcript contains both boot and NPU ML PASS markers, the aggregate target
   must remain BLOCKED instead of inventing proof.
