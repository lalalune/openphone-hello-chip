# OpenPhone Hello Chip

This repository is a CLI-first pre-tapeout scaffold for an open RISC-V AI phone SoC. The current executable milestone is a small `hello_soc` pipeline that ties together architecture contracts, RTL, cocotb/formal verification, QEMU/Renode software-facing smoke targets, FPGA/package evidence, and physical-design entry points.

The hello chip is not the final phone SoC. It is the smallest end-to-end system used to prove the project conventions, evidence gates, and tool setup before scaling the design.

## Repository Layout

- `rtl/`: SystemVerilog RTL for the hello chip, NPU, DMA, display, interconnect, interrupt, memory, and CPU/AP stubs.
- `verify/`: cocotb tests, formal properties, and verification status artifacts.
- `compiler/runtime/`: Python runtime and simulator-facing NPU contract checks.
- `fw/`: boot ROM, bare-metal, and OpenSBI payload experiments.
- `sw/`: Linux, Buildroot, OpenSBI, U-Boot, and AOSP BSP scaffolds.
- `scripts/`: project gates, evidence capture, build orchestration, and simulator helpers.
- `benchmarks/`: benchmark plans, parsers, metadata, and dry-run tooling.
- `docs/`: architecture, software, evidence, PD, package, FPGA, simulator, and project planning docs.
- `pd/`, `board/`, `package/`: physical-design, board, packaging, and signoff artifacts.

## Quick Start

Use Python 3.11 or newer. From a fresh checkout:

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
make tools
make smoke
```

`make smoke` runs the locally available low-cost checks. Some checks report `BLOCKED` when an external EDA, simulator, BSP, Android, or hardware dependency is absent; those blockers are expected on a minimal laptop setup and are captured as evidence rather than hidden.

## Docker Setup

Docker is the most reproducible starting point for a new machine:

```sh
docker build -t openphone-soc-tools .
docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD:/work" -w /work openphone-soc-tools make smoke
```

Use the Docker path when host package versions are inconvenient or when you need a clean Linux-like environment from macOS.

## macOS Setup

Install baseline tools with Homebrew:

```sh
brew install python make verilator yosys qemu dtc
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
make tools
make smoke
```

macOS caveats:

- Apple Silicon and Intel Macs can run the Python gates, docs checks, QEMU reference checks, and many RTL/synthesis checks.
- Full Linux BSP builds, OpenLane/OpenROAD closure, Chipyard/Verilator generation, and Android/Cuttlefish flows are best run in Linux or Docker.
- OpenSBI and bare-metal RISC-V builds may require a cross compiler such as `riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc` or `riscv64-elf-gcc`; `make tools` reports what is available.
- Docker Desktop file sharing must include the checkout directory for containerized flows.

## Linux Setup

On Ubuntu/Debian-like hosts:

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y \
  build-essential git make python3 python3-venv python3-pip \
  device-tree-compiler qemu-system-misc verilator yosys
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
make tools
make smoke
```

Linux caveats:

- Package names differ across distributions; use equivalent packages for Fedora, Arch, Nix, or enterprise Linux.
- OpenLane/OpenROAD, Chipyard, Android/Cuttlefish, and full kernel/Buildroot builds have large dependency sets and are documented under `docs/`, `sw/`, and `scripts/`.
- Some flows need Docker privileges, KVM access, or a RISC-V cross toolchain. Run `make tools` first and follow the reported missing-tool output.

## Common Targets

```text
make tools                         show local tool availability
make venv                          create .venv and install Python dependencies
make lint                          run ruff
make typecheck                     run mypy
make docs-check                    validate documentation skeletons
make smoke                         run locally available low-cost gates
make ci-fast                       run broader RTL/software/project checks
make cocotb                        run cocotb RTL tests when simulator tools exist
make formal                        run SymbiYosys checks when available
make synth                         run Yosys synthesis
make qemu-check                    run QEMU reference checks
make renode-check                  run Renode reference checks when available
make mvp-status                    report subsystem PASS/BLOCK/FAIL status
make product-check                 run product/evidence gates
make clean                         remove generated local build outputs
```

## External Flow Notes

- Chipyard generation and Linux boot smoke flows are wired through `scripts/bootstrap_chipyard.sh`, `scripts/generate_chipyard_openphone.py`, `scripts/run_chipyard_openphone_linux_smoke.sh`, and related `make chipyard-*` targets.
- Linux BSP import and evidence capture are under `sw/linux/scripts/` and `docs/sw/linux/`.
- Buildroot package scaffolds and import checks are under `sw/buildroot/` and `docs/sw/buildroot/`.
- OpenSBI, U-Boot, boot ROM, and QEMU/Renode boot-tier status are documented under `docs/sw/`, `docs/boot-rom/`, and `docs/sim/`.
- OpenLane/OpenROAD runs are local generated artifacts. Commit reports and evidence summaries, not machine-local lock directories or object files.

## Verification Discipline

The project treats unsupported local tools as explicit blockers. A check should either pass, fail with a concrete issue, or record a `BLOCKED` evidence artifact that explains the missing dependency or external handoff. Before claiming a milestone, run the relevant make target and update the associated evidence docs.
